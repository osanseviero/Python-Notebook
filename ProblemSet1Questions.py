# Problem set 1.

# Exercise 1: Reverse a string
# Write a function that will take a string as input, and return a new
# string with the same letters in reverse order.
# Don't use String's reverse function; that would be too simple.


# Exercise 2: Factorial
# Have the function FirstFactorial(num) take the num parameter being passed and return the factorial of it.

# Exercise 3: Longest word in string
# Have the function LongestWord(sen) take the sen parameter being passed and return the largest word in the string. 
# If there are two or more words that are the same length, return the first word from the string with that length. 
# Ignore punctuation and assume sen will not be empty. 

# Exercise 4: Adding
# Have the function SimpleAdding(num) add up all the numbers from 1 to num.
